 abstract = {Regulatory variation in gene expression can be described by cis-
and trans-genetic components. Here we used RNA-seq data from a
population panel of Drosophila melanogaster test crosses to
compare allelic imbalance (AI) in female head tissue between
mated and virgin flies, an environmental change known to affect
transcription. Indeed, 3048 exons (1610 genes) are differentially
expressed in this study. A Bayesian model for AI, with an
intersection test, controls type I error. There are ∼200 genes
with AI exclusively in mated or virgin flies, indicating an
environmental component of expression regulation. On average 34%
of genes within a cross and 54% of all genes show evidence for
genetic regulation of transcription. Nearly all differentially
regulated genes are affected in cis, with an average of 63% of
expression variation explained by the cis-effects. Trans-effects
explain 8% of the variance in AI on average and the interaction
between cis and trans explains an average of 11% of the total
variance in AI. In both environments cis- and trans-effects are
compensatory in their overall effect, with a negative association
between cis- and trans-effects in 85% of the exons examined. We
hypothesize that the gene expression level perturbed by
cis-regulatory mutations is compensated through trans-regulatory
mechanisms, e.g., trans and cis by trans-factors buffering
cis-mutations. In addition, when AI is detected in both
environments, cis-mated, cis-virgin, and trans-mated-trans-virgin
estimates are highly concordant with 99% of all exons positively
correlated with a median correlation of 0.83 for cis and 0.95 for
trans We conclude that the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are
robust and that trans-buffering explains robustness.},
