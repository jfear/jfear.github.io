 abstract = {During early development, the mammalian embryo is resistant to
pro-apoptotic signals because of biochemical properties of the
mitochondrion and nucleus. Mitochondria of the bovine two-cell
embryo are resistant to depolarization because of low amounts of
the proapoptotic protein BAX and high concentrations of the
anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. As development proceeds, BAX content
increases, BCL2 content declines, and mitochondria becomes
capable of pore formation and depolarization in response to
pro-apoptotic signals. The nucleus of the two-cell embryo is
resistant to degradation by the DNase DFFB because epigenetic
modifications, including DNA methylation and histone
deacetylation, mask internucleosomal sites for DNA cleavage.
Blastomere DNA becomes progressively less methylated during
development so that DNA becomes accessible to cleavage by DFFB.},
