 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Drosophila sex determination hierarchy is a
classic example of a transcriptional regulatory hierarchy, with
sex-specific isoforms regulating morphology and behavior. We use
a structural equation modeling approach, leveraging natural
genetic variation from two studies on Drosophila female head
tissues--DSPR collection (596 F1-hybrids from crosses between
DSPR sub-populations) and CEGS population (75 F1-hybrids from
crosses between DGRP/Winters lines to a reference strain
w1118)--to expand understanding of the sex hierarchy gene
regulatory network (GRN). This approach is completely
generalizable to any natural population, including humans.
RESULTS: We expanded the sex hierarchy GRN adding novel links
among genes, including a link from fruitless (fru) to Sex-lethal
(Sxl) identified in both populations. This link is further
supported by the presence of fru binding sites in the Sxl locus.
754 candidate genes were added to the pathway, including the
splicing factors male-specific lethal 2 and Rm62 as downstream
targets of Sxl which are well-supported links in males.
Independent studies of doublesex and transformer mutants support
many additions, including evidence for a link between the sex
hierarchy and metabolism, via Insulin-like receptor. CONCLUSIONS:
The genes added in the CEGS population were enriched for genes
with sex-biased splicing and components of the spliceosome. A
common goal of molecular biologists is to expand understanding
about regulatory interactions among genes. Using natural alleles
we can not only identify novel relationships, but using
supervised approaches can order genes into a regulatory
hierarchy. Combining these results with independent large effect
mutation studies, allows clear candidates for detailed molecular
follow-up to emerge.},
