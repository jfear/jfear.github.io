 abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) describe regulatory relationships
between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes.
Computational methods to infer GRNs typically combine evidence
across different conditions to infer context-agnostic networks.
We develop a method, Network Reprogramming using EXpression
(NetREX), that constructs a context-specific GRN given
context-specific expression data and a context-agnostic prior
network. NetREX remodels the prior network to obtain the topology
that provides the best explanation for expression data. Because
NetREX utilizes prior network topology, we also develop
PriorBoost, a method that evaluates a prior network in terms of
its consistency with the expression data. We validate NetREX and
PriorBoost using the ``gold standard'' E. coli GRN from the
DREAM5 network inference challenge and apply them to construct
sex-specific Drosophila GRNs. NetREX constructed sex-specific
Drosophila GRNs that, on all applied measures, outperform
networks obtained from other methods indicating that NetREX is an
important milestone toward building more accurate GRNs.},
