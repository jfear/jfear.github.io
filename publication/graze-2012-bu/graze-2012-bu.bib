 abstract = {Unraveling how regulatory divergence contributes to species
differences and adaptation requires identifying functional
variants from among millions of genetic differences. Analysis of
allelic imbalance (AI) reveals functional genetic differences in
cis regulation and has demonstrated differences in cis regulation
within and between species. Regulatory mechanisms are often
highly conserved, yet differences between species in gene
expression are extensive. What evolutionary forces explain
widespread divergence in cis regulation? AI was assessed in
Drosophila melanogaster-Drosophila simulans hybrid female heads
using RNA-seq technology. Mapping bias was virtually eliminated
by using genotype-specific references. Allele representation in
DNA sequencing was used as a prior in a novel Bayesian model for
the estimation of AI in RNA. Cis regulatory divergence was common
in the organs and tissues of the head with 41% of genes analyzed
showing significant AI. Using existing population genomic data,
the relationship between AI and patterns of sequence evolution
was examined. Evidence of positive selection was found in 30% of
cis regulatory divergent genes. Genes involved in defense,
RNAi/RISC complex genes, and those that are sex regulated are
enriched among adaptively evolving cis regulatory divergent
genes. For genes in these groups, adaptive evolution may play a
role in regulatory divergence between species. However, there is
no evidence that adaptive evolution drives most of the cis
regulatory divergence that is observed. The majority of genes
showed patterns consistent with stabilizing selection and neutral
evolutionary processes.},
