 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drosophila melanogaster adult males perform an
elaborate courtship ritual to entice females to mate. fruitless
(fru), a gene that is one of the key regulators of male courtship
behavior, encodes multiple male-specific isoforms (Fru(M)). These
isoforms vary in their carboxy-terminal zinc finger domains,
which are predicted to facilitate DNA binding. RESULTS: By
over-expressing individual Fru(M) isoforms in fru-expressing
neurons in either males or females and assaying the global
transcriptional response by RNA-sequencing, we show that three
Fru(M) isoforms have different regulatory activities that depend
on the sex of the fly. We identified several sets of genes
regulated downstream of Fru(M) isoforms, including many annotated
with neuronal functions. By determining the binding sites of
individual Fru(M) isoforms using SELEX we demonstrate that the
distinct zinc finger domain of each Fru(M) isoforms confers
different DNA binding specificities. A genome-wide search for
these binding site sequences finds that the gene sets identified
as induced by over-expression of Fru(M) isoforms in males are
enriched for genes that contain the binding sites. An analysis of
the chromosomal distribution of genes downstream of Fru(M) shows
that those that are induced and repressed in males are highly
enriched and depleted on the X chromosome, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the different regulatory and
DNA binding activities of three Fru(M) isoforms on a genome-wide
scale and identifies genes regulated by these isoforms. These
results add to our understanding of sex chromosome biology and
further support the hypothesis that in some cell-types genes with
male-biased expression are enriched on the X chromosome.},
