 abstract = {The early bovine preimplantation embryo is resistant to
proapoptotic signals until around the 8- to 16-cell stage. We
hypothesized that 2-cell embryos have higher amounts of
antiapoptotic proteins and lower amounts of proapoptotic proteins
when compared to embryos $≥$16 cells. Steady-state
concentrations of mRNA for the antiapoptotic genes BCL2 and
HSPA1A were higher for MII oocytes, 2-cell embryos, and 2-cell
embryos treated with alpha-amanitin as compared to $≥$16-cell
embryos. Steady-state concentrations of mRNA for the proapoptotic
gene BAD increased in embryos $≥$16 cells. There was no
significant effect of stage of development on steady-state mRNA
concentrations of BCL2L1, DFFA, or BAX. Using
immunohistochemistry, it was found that BCL2 was present in
greater relative concentrations for 2-cell embryos than for
embryos $≥$16 cells. These results were confirmed by Western
blotting. Relative amounts of immunoreactive BAX detected by
immunofluorescence were lower for 2-cell embryos than for embryos
$≥$16 cells. Using Western blotting, a high molecular weight
(46 kDa) form of BAX was highest in $≥$16-cell embryos,
intermediate in 2-cell embryos, and lowest in MII oocytes. There
were no effects of stage of development on relative amounts of
immunoreactive BCL2L1, HSPA1A, or BAD, as determined by
immunofluorescence. Treatment of embryos with alpha-amanitin from
Day 0 to Day 5 or Day 4 to Day 5 after insemination reduced
activation of group II caspases and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling after treatment with the
proapoptotic signal C(2) ceramide at Day 5 after fertilization.
Thus, transcription of BAX or other proteins is required for
acquisition of the capacity for apoptosis. Results support the
idea that changes in amounts of BCL2 family members are important
for the inhibition of apoptosis in the 2-cell embryo and in the
establishment of the capacity for apoptosis later in development.},
