 abstract = {Animals inheriting the slick hair gene have a short, sleek, and
sometimes glossy coat. The objective of the present study was to
determine whether slick-haired Holstein cows regulate body
temperature more effectively than wild-type Holstein cows when
exposed to an acute increase in heat stress. Lactating slick cows
(n = 10) and wild-type cows (n = 10) were placed for 10 h in an
indoor environment with a solid roof, fans, and evaporative
cooling or in an outdoor environment with shade cloth and no fans
or evaporative cooling. Cows were exposed to both environments in
a single reversal design. Vaginal temperature, respiration rate,
surface temperature, and sweating rate were measured at 1200,
1500, 1800, and 2100 h (replicate 1) or 1200 and 1500 h
(replicate 2), and blood samples were collected for plasma
cortisol concentration. Cows in the outdoor environment had
higher vaginal and surface temperatures, respiration rates, and
sweating rates than cows in the indoor environment. In both
environments, slick-haired cows had lower vaginal temperatures
(indoor: 39.0 vs. 39.4 degrees C; outdoor 39.6 vs. 40.2 degrees
C; SEM = 0.07) and respiration rate (indoor: 67 vs. 79 breaths/
min; outdoor 97 vs. 107 breaths/min; SEM = 5.5) than wild-type
cows and greater sweating rates in unclipped areas of skin
(indoor: 57 vs. 43 g x h(-1)/m(2); outdoor 82 vs. 61 g x
h(-1)/m(2); SEM = 8). Clipping the hair at the site of sweating
measurement eliminated the difference between slick-haired and
wild-type cows. Results indicate that slick-haired Holstein cows
can regulate body temperature more effectively than wild-type
cows during heat stress. One reason slick-haired animals are
better able to regulate body temperature is increased sweating
rate.},
