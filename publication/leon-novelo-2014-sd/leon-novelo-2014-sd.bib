 abstract = {BACKGROUND: One method of identifying cis regulatory differences
is to analyze allele-specific expression (ASE) and identify cases
of allelic imbalance (AI). RNA-seq is the most common way to
measure ASE and a binomial test is often applied to determine
statistical significance of AI. This implicitly assumes that
there is no bias in estimation of AI. However, bias has been
found to result from multiple factors including: genome
ambiguity, reference quality, the mapping algorithm, and biases
in the sequencing process. Two alternative approaches have been
developed to handle bias: adjusting for bias using a statistical
model and filtering regions of the genome suspected of harboring
bias. Existing statistical models which account for bias rely on
information from DNA controls, which can be cost prohibitive for
large intraspecific studies. In contrast, data filtering is
inexpensive and straightforward, but necessarily involves
sacrificing a portion of the data. RESULTS: Here we propose a
flexible Bayesian model for analysis of AI, which accounts for
bias and can be implemented without DNA controls. In lieu of DNA
controls, this Poisson-Gamma (PG) model uses an estimate of bias
from simulations. The proposed model always has a lower type I
error rate compared to the binomial test. Consistent with prior
studies, bias dramatically affects the type I error rate. All of
the tested models are sensitive to misspecification of bias. The
closer the estimate of bias is to the true underlying bias, the
lower the type I error rate. Correct estimates of bias result in
a level alpha test. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the assessment of AI,
some forms of systematic error (e.g., map bias) can be identified
using simulation. The resulting estimates of bias can be used to
correct for bias in the PG model, without data filtering. Other
sources of bias (e.g., unidentified variant calls) can be easily
captured by DNA controls, but are missed by common filtering
approaches. Consequently, as variant identification improves, the
need for DNA controls will be reduced. Filtering does not
significantly improve performance and is not recommended, as
information is sacrificed without a measurable gain. The PG model
developed here performs well when bias is known, or slightly
misspecified. The model is flexible and can accommodate
differences in experimental design and bias estimation.},
