 abstract = {Sex differences in gene expression have been widely studied in
Drosophila melanogaster Sex differences vary across strains, but
many molecular studies focus on only a single strain, or on genes
that show sexually dimorphic expression in many strains. How
extensive variability is and whether this variability occurs
among genes regulated by sex determination hierarchy terminal
transcription factors is unknown. To address these questions, we
examine differences in sexually dimorphic gene expression between
two strains in Drosophila adult head tissues. We also examine
gene expression in doublesex (dsx) mutant strains to determine
which sex-differentially expressed genes are regulated by DSX,
and the mode by which DSX regulates expression. We find
substantial variation in sex-differential expression. The sets of
genes with sexually dimorphic expression in each strain show
little overlap. The prevalence of different DSX regulatory modes
also varies between the two strains. Neither the patterns of DSX
DNA occupancy, nor mode of DSX regulation explain why some genes
show consistent sex-differential expression across strains. We
find that the genes identified as regulated by DSX in this study
are enriched with known sites of DSX DNA occupancy. Finally, we
find that sex-differentially expressed genes and genes regulated
by DSX are highly enriched on the fourth chromosome. These
results provide insights into a more complete pool of potential
DSX targets, as well as revealing the molecular flexibility of
DSX regulation.},
