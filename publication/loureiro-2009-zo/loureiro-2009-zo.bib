 abstract = {In this study, we tested the role of colony-stimulating factor 2
(CSF2) as one of the regulatory molecules that mediate maternal
effects on embryonic development during the preimplantation
period. Our objective was to verify effects of CSF2 on blastocyst
yield, determine posttransfer survival, and evaluate properties
of the blastocyst formed after CSF2 treatment. In vitro, CSF2
increased the percentage of oocytes that became morulae and
blastocysts. Blastocysts that were treated with CSF2 tended to
have a greater number of inner cell mass cells and had a higher
ratio of inner cell mass to trophectoderm cells. There was no
effect of CSF2 on the incidence of apoptosis. Treatment with CSF2
from d 5 to 7 after insemination increased embryonic survival as
indicated by improved pregnancy rate at d 30-35 of gestation.
Moreover, treatment with CSF2 from either d 1-7 or 5-7 after
insemination reduced pregnancy loss after d 30-35. Results
indicate that treatment with CSF2 can affect embryonic
development and enhance embryo competence for posttransfer
survival. The fact that treatment with CSF2 during such a narrow
window of development altered embryonic function much later in
pregnancy suggests that CSF2 may exert epigenetic effects on the
developing embryo that result in persistent changes in function
during the embryonic and fetal periods of development.},
