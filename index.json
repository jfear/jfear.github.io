There are ∼200 genes with AI exclusively in mated or virgin flies, indicating an environmental component of expression regulation. On average 34% of genes within a cross and 54% of all genes show evidence for genetic regulation of transcription. Nearly all differentially regulated genes are affected in cis, with an average of 63% of expression variation explained by the cis-effects. Trans-effects explain 8% of the variance in AI on average and the interaction between cis and trans explains an average of 11% of the total variance in AI. In both environments cis- and trans-effects are compensatory in their overall effect, with a negative association between cis- and trans-effects in 85% of the exons examined. We hypothesize that the gene expression level perturbed by cis-regulatory mutations is compensated through trans-regulatory mechanisms, e.g., trans and cis by trans-factors buffering cis-mutations. In addition, when AI is detected in both environments, cis-mated, cis-virgin, and trans-mated-trans-virgin estimates are highly concordant with 99% of all exons positively correlated with a median correlation of 0.83 for cis and 0.95 for trans We conclude that the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are robust and that trans-buffering explains robustness.","tags":["Drosophila; allele-specific expression; cis- or trans-effects; genetic variation; purifying selection; regulatory mutations; transcription"],"title":"Buffering of Genetic Regulatory Networks in Drosophila melanogaster","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michelle N Arbeitman","Felicia N New","Justin M Fear","Tiffany S Howard","Justin E Dalton","Rita M Graze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"ec9796ce3ce057124f40a6ea21d7f004","permalink":"/publication/arbeitman-2016-mz/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T19:46:26.601954Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arbeitman-2016-mz/","section":"publication","summary":"Sex differences in gene expression have been widely studied in Drosophila melanogaster Sex differences vary across strains, but many molecular studies focus on only a single strain, or on genes that show sexually dimorphic expression in many strains. How extensive variability is and whether this variability occurs among genes regulated by sex determination hierarchy terminal transcription factors is unknown. To address these questions, we examine differences in sexually dimorphic gene expression between two strains in Drosophila adult head tissues. We also examine gene expression in doublesex (dsx) mutant strains to determine which sex-differentially expressed genes are regulated by DSX, and the mode by which DSX regulates expression. We find substantial variation in sex-differential expression. The sets of genes with sexually dimorphic expression in each strain show little overlap. The prevalence of different DSX regulatory modes also varies between the two strains. Neither the patterns of DSX DNA occupancy, nor mode of DSX regulation explain why some genes show consistent sex-differential expression across strains. We find that the genes identified as regulated by DSX in this study are enriched with known sites of DSX DNA occupancy. Finally, we find that sex-differentially expressed genes and genes regulated by DSX are highly enriched on the fourth chromosome. These results provide insights into a more complete pool of potential DSX targets, as well as revealing the molecular flexibility of DSX regulation.","tags":["Drosophila; Genetics of Sex; RNA-seq; doublesex; gene expression; sex bias; sex determination; sex hierarchy; transcriptome"],"title":"Sex Differences in Drosophila Somatic Gene Expression: Variation and Regulation by doublesex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justin Fear","Brian Oliver"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"dbd9fd6b1c340c13e9d6273b29f6c62b","permalink":"/publication/fear-2016-bu/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T19:46:26.602603Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fear-2016-bu/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Developmental biology: Females have a lot of guts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justin M Fear","Michelle N Arbeitman","Matthew P Salomon","Justin E Dalton","John Tower","Sergey V Nuzhdin","Lauren M McIntyre"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"8e7ac788d295feb2321e4e259b07ed7e","permalink":"/publication/fear-2015-zs/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T19:46:26.602901Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fear-2015-zs/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: The Drosophila sex determination hierarchy is a classic example of a transcriptional regulatory hierarchy, with sex-specific isoforms regulating morphology and behavior. We use a structural equation modeling approach, leveraging natural genetic variation from two studies on Drosophila female head tissues--DSPR collection (596 F1-hybrids from crosses between DSPR sub-populations) and CEGS population (75 F1-hybrids from crosses between DGRP/Winters lines to a reference strain w1118)--to expand understanding of the sex hierarchy gene regulatory network (GRN). This approach is completely generalizable to any natural population, including humans. RESULTS: We expanded the sex hierarchy GRN adding novel links among genes, including a link from fruitless (fru) to Sex-lethal (Sxl) identified in both populations. This link is further supported by the presence of fru binding sites in the Sxl locus. 754 candidate genes were added to the pathway, including the splicing factors male-specific lethal 2 and Rm62 as downstream targets of Sxl which are well-supported links in males. Independent studies of doublesex and transformer mutants support many additions, including evidence for a link between the sex hierarchy and metabolism, via Insulin-like receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The genes added in the CEGS population were enriched for genes with sex-biased splicing and components of the spliceosome. A common goal of molecular biologists is to expand understanding about regulatory interactions among genes. Using natural alleles we can not only identify novel relationships, but using supervised approaches can order genes into a regulatory hierarchy. Combining these results with independent large effect mutation studies, allows clear candidates for detailed molecular follow-up to emerge.","tags":null,"title":"The Wright stuff: reimagining path analysis reveals novel components of the sex determination hierarchy in Drosophila melanogaster","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis G León-Novelo","Lauren M McIntyre","Justin M Fear","Rita M Graze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412121600,"objectID":"d5c3b6bd3c5ef374d635562d31815477","permalink":"/publication/leon-novelo-2014-sd/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T19:46:26.603232Z","relpermalink":"/publication/leon-novelo-2014-sd/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: One method of identifying cis regulatory differences is to analyze allele-specific expression (ASE) and identify cases of allelic imbalance (AI). RNA-seq is the most common way to measure ASE and a binomial test is often applied to determine statistical significance of AI. This implicitly assumes that there is no bias in estimation of AI. However, bias has been found to result from multiple factors including: genome ambiguity, reference quality, the mapping algorithm, and biases in the sequencing process. Two alternative approaches have been developed to handle bias: adjusting for bias using a statistical model and filtering regions of the genome suspected of harboring bias. Existing statistical models which account for bias rely on information from DNA controls, which can be cost prohibitive for large intraspecific studies. In contrast, data filtering is inexpensive and straightforward, but necessarily involves sacrificing a portion of the data. RESULTS: Here we propose a flexible Bayesian model for analysis of AI, which accounts for bias and can be implemented without DNA controls. In lieu of DNA controls, this Poisson-Gamma (PG) model uses an estimate of bias from simulations. The proposed model always has a lower type I error rate compared to the binomial test. Consistent with prior studies, bias dramatically affects the type I error rate. All of the tested models are sensitive to misspecification of bias. The closer the estimate of bias is to the true underlying bias, the lower the type I error rate. Correct estimates of bias result in a level alpha test. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the assessment of AI, some forms of systematic error (e.g., map bias) can be identified using simulation. The resulting estimates of bias can be used to correct for bias in the PG model, without data filtering. Other sources of bias (e.g., unidentified variant calls) can be easily captured by DNA controls, but are missed by common filtering approaches. Consequently, as variant identification improves, the need for DNA controls will be reduced. Filtering does not significantly improve performance and is not recommended, as information is sacrificed without a measurable gain. The PG model developed here performs well when bias is known, or slightly misspecified. The model is flexible and can accommodate differences in experimental design and bias estimation.","tags":null,"title":"A flexible Bayesian method for detecting allelic imbalance in RNA-seq data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y Yang","J Fear","J Hu","I Haecker","L Zhou"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"3d9c16b38ff36b91c9a2b0ed351d633e","permalink":"/publication/yang-2014-ew/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T19:46:26.603556Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-2014-ew/","section":"publication","summary":"ChIP-seq experiments identify genome-wide profiles of DNA-binding molecules including transcription factors, enzymes and epigenetic marks.

These isoforms vary in their carboxy-terminal zinc finger domains, which are predicted to facilitate DNA binding. RESULTS: By over-expressing individual Fru(M) isoforms in fru-expressing neurons in either males or females and assaying the global transcriptional response by RNA-sequencing, we show that three Fru(M) isoforms have different regulatory activities that depend on the sex of the fly. We identified several sets of genes regulated downstream of Fru(M) isoforms, including many annotated with neuronal functions. By determining the binding sites of individual Fru(M) isoforms using SELEX we demonstrate that the distinct zinc finger domain of each Fru(M) isoforms confers different DNA binding specificities. A genome-wide search for these binding site sequences finds that the gene sets identified as induced by over-expression of Fru(M) isoforms in males are enriched for genes that contain the binding sites. An analysis of the chromosomal distribution of genes downstream of Fru(M) shows that those that are induced and repressed in males are highly enriched and depleted on the X chromosome, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the different regulatory and DNA binding activities of three Fru(M) isoforms on a genome-wide scale and identifies genes regulated by these isoforms.

Analysis of allelic imbalance (AI) reveals functional genetic differences in cis regulation and has demonstrated differences in cis regulation within and between species. Regulatory mechanisms are often highly conserved, yet differences between species in gene expression are extensive. What evolutionary forces explain widespread divergence in cis regulation? AI was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster-Drosophila simulans hybrid female heads using RNA-seq technology. Mapping bias was virtually eliminated by using genotype-specific references. Allele representation in DNA sequencing was used as a prior in a novel Bayesian model for the estimation of AI in RNA. Cis regulatory divergence was common in the organs and tissues of the head with 41% of genes analyzed showing significant AI. Using existing population genomic data, the relationship between AI and patterns of sequence evolution was examined. Evidence of positive selection was found in 30% of cis regulatory divergent genes. Genes involved in defense, RNAi/RISC complex genes, and those that are sex regulated are enriched among adaptively evolving cis regulatory divergent genes. For genes in these groups, adaptive evolution may play a role in regulatory divergence between species. However, there is no evidence that adaptive evolution drives most of the cis regulatory divergence that is observed. The majority of genes showed patterns consistent with stabilizing selection and neutral evolutionary processes.","tags":null,"title":"Allelic imbalance in Drosophila hybrid heads: exons, isoforms, and evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter J Hansen","Justin M Fear"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1314835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1314835200,"objectID":"63d643cc4c166d37545640c018c47c64","permalink":"/publication/hansen-2011-wk/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T19:46:26.604433Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hansen-2011-wk/","section":"publication","summary":"During early development, the mammalian embryo is resistant to pro-apoptotic signals because of biochemical properties of the mitochondrion and nucleus.

Steady-state concentrations of mRNA for the antiapoptotic genes BCL2 and HSPA1A were higher for MII oocytes, 2-cell embryos, and 2-cell embryos treated with alpha-amanitin as compared to $≥$16-cell embryos.

Relative amounts of immunoreactive BAX detected by immunofluorescence were lower for 2-cell embryos than for embryos $≥$16 cells.

One reason slick-haired animals are better able to regulate body temperature is increased sweating rate.","tags":null,"title":"Differences in thermoregulatory ability between slick-haired and wild-type lactating Holstein cows in response to acute heat stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B Loureiro","L Bonilla","J Block","J M Fear"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"3bfddf1b0484a42a80e978c35208b619","permalink":"/publication/loureiro-2008-nj/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T19:46:26.606664Z","relpermalink":"/publication/loureiro-2008-nj/","section":"publication","summary":"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a multifunctional cytokine that has been implicated in the regulation of preimplantation embryonic development in several species.
